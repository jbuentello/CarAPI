# CarAPI
This API uses Ajax to pull data from the GIF site.
The data can be referenced by rating and by allowing each button clicked to grab that value and search the site.
Once Ajax pulls the info, it is parsed the distibuted to the proper divs in the html.
Once the vehicles are searched the GIFS are displayed, they prepend each other making it so the most recent are displayed.
The input form allows for new vehicles to be added.
